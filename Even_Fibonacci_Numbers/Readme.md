## Question

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1,2,5,8,12,21,34,55,89.
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution
create a list to fill with fibonacci numbers less than 4000000, then sum up the even ones.
